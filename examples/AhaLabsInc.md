Roadmaps are a popular strategic planning method for businesses and teams of all kinds. Many organizations use a variety of roadmaps types in aha! software such as business, technology, project, and marketing road maps. Roadmaps help leaders define a workable plan their team can believe in and follow. Product managers maintain a product roadmap focused on communicating the product vision and putting plans in action. Marketing managers build a marketing roadmap to align groups around integrated marketing plans and all related activities. Project managers communicate a timeline for project goals, tasks and assignments. A project plan is a supporting document that lays out the specifics of what you need to do to achieve those initiatives. It's a visual representation of your strategic initiatives and the major areas of work you will pursue. The best part about roadmapping is that the views are automatically updated whenever you make changes to your data giving you back your time (and sanity). A roadmap can provide the clarity needed to move ahead to the work that will bring you closer to meeting your goals. There are few common elements: goals, priorities, time frames, prioritized work, epics and initiatives that show the value of that work and how it brings the business to market. This is an example of a well-known road map....

What you create today represents the future of the business. Value-based product development is an end-to-end process that enables product teams to create the most value for the least effort. It is a practical way to look holistically at the overall worth of what you prioritize, the effort it takes to build, and the actual benefit of doing so. Aha! software offers a 30-day trial free for 30 days, so why not take advantage of it? The guide explains how to use it and explains the difference between value based pricing (based on the customer's perception of a product's worth and actual cost to produce) and agile workflows (where the focus is on developing the product and not on making quick decisions). It also explains why it is important to paint a full picture of an organization's investment in the development of its products and how it can be used to improve the quality of their products, as well as to promote them to the right customers and to their intended audience.
