confluence is a connected workspace for teams of all sizes that need a hub for company-wide knowledge. It's open-by-default design philosophy means everyone with access to your confluence site can access content unless you choose to restrict permissions. Whiteboards mimic in-office whiteboards of the past but are supercharged with the ability to convert sticky notes into jira tickets with one click. Smart links connect other popular apps like figma and google drive to create a moveable interface rich with timers, votes, and more. The website has an active marketplace with active integrations with back-to-back pages and it's easy to collaborate on one place and keep all the work organized on the other place. Confluence was designed to digitally replicate the environment where you write, edit and discuss your work, real-time co-editing with teammates, comments, version history and notifications make collaborating on a single page an easy process. To be able to grow at 80,000+ people, knowledge needs to be passed on, conserved and consolidated so that the entire company works moreefficiently. For example, the customer success team identifies a bug in a product, which they pass to the product team to triage and when engineering starts working on that fix....
