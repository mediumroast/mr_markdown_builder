    "abstract": "confluence is a connected workspace for teams of all sizes that need a hub for company-wide knowledge. It's open-by-default design philosophy means everyone with access to your confluence site can access content unless you choose to restrict permissions. Whiteboards mimic in-office whiteboards of the past but are supercharged with the ability to convert sticky notes into jira tickets with one click. Smart links connect other popular apps like figma and google drive to create a moveable interface rich with timers, votes, and more.

Confluence was designed to digitally replicate the environment where you write, edit and discuss your work, real-time co-editing with teammates, comments, version history and notifications make collaborating on a single page an easy process. To be able to grow at 80,000+ people, knowledge needs to be passed on, conserved and consolidated so that the entire company works moreefficiently. For example, the customer success team identifies a bug in a product, which they pass to the product team to triage and when engineering starts working on that fix....",

    "abstract": "monday.com announces the launch of mondaydb 1.0, the next version of the company's work os platform re-engineered with a new infrastructure. The new version provides dramatic improvements to speed and scalability, as well as extended functionality for true flexibility when constructing applications atop the platform. It has already been rolled out to 186,000 customers and is expected to reach half a billion users in the first half of 2024. Its performance will continue to scale as an organization does, supporting both growth and expansion into complexity, thanks to a few key technologies: Columnar data structure, which provides flexible and efficient access to large quantities of data, and a Schema-less architecture that can store, retrieve and query any data type, accommodating enterprises with unique needs and goals.

    "abstract": "Roadmaps are a popular strategic planning method for businesses and teams of all kinds. Many organizations use a variety of roadmaps types in aha! software such as business, technology, project, and marketing road maps. Roadmaps help leaders define a workable plan their team can believe in and follow. Product managers maintain a product roadmap focused on communicating the product vision and putting plans in action. Marketing managers build a marketing roadmap to align groups around integrated marketing plans and all related activities. Project managers communicate a timeline for project goals, tasks and assignments. A project plan is a supporting document that lays out the specifics of what you need to do to achieve those initiatives. It's a visual representation of your strategic initiatives and the major areas of work you will pursue. The best part about roadmapping is that the views are automatically updated whenever you make changes to your data giving you back your time (and sanity). A roadmap can provide the clarity needed to move ahead to the work that will bring you closer to meeting your goals. There are few common elements: goals, priorities, time frames, prioritized work, epics and initiatives that show the value of that work and how it brings the business to market. This is an example of a well-known road map....",

    "abstract": "What you create today represents the future of the business. Value-based product development is an end-to-end process that enables product teams to create the most value for the least effort. It is a practical way to look holistically at the overall worth of what you prioritize, the effort it takes to build, and the actual benefit of doing so. Aha! software offers a 30-day trial free for 30 days, so why not take advantage of it? The guide explains how to use it and explains the difference between value based pricing (based on the customer's perception of a product's worth and actual cost to produce) and agile workflows (where the focus is on developing the product and not on making quick decisions). It also explains why it is important to paint a full picture of an organization's investment in the development of its products and how it can be used to improve the quality of their products, as well as to promote them to the right customers and to their intended audience.
