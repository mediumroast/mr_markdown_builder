monday.com has just launched a new form-building app called workforms and a collaborative whiteboard app named canvas. Both are stand-alone products with their own pricing, development teams, and roadmaps. It's an answer to modern document editors such as notion and coda, which have gradually fashioned themselves into all-in-one tools for project management. Monday started with forms and whiteboards because both are gaining traction among businesses and make sense as standalone products. In canvas, the team was able to focus on supporting up to 100 collaborators at a smooth 60 frames per second, because it's not tied to monday's core service. The company is committed to improving the products over time and stresses that each team has complete autonomy. Even if they're independent, both products will still lean on integration with the core m Monday's platform what the company calls its work os "to stand out. in work forms" and work-form-as-a-solution-towards-the-people-using-them-and-it-is-simplistic-but-focuses-on-what-they-want-to-do-at-all-while-being-very-focused on the broader platform....

monday.com announces the launch of mondaydb 1.0, the next version of the company's work os platform re-engineered with a new infrastructure. The new version provides dramatic improvements to speed and scalability, as well as extended functionality for true flexibility when constructing applications atop the platform. It has already been rolled out to 186,000 customers and is expected to reach half a billion users in the first half of 2024. Its performance will continue to scale as an organization does, supporting both growth and expansion into complexity, thanks to a few key technologies: Columnar data structure, which provides flexible and efficient access to large quantities of data, and a Schema-less architecture that can store, retrieve and query any data type, accommodating enterprises with unique needs and goals. Developers can leverage the open API to build their own apps on top of Mondaycom's platform, armed with data analysis capabilities, to make their innovative ideas into a reality. For more information, please visit Monday's website or learn more about Monday DB 1 0, or visit www.moondaycom’s website, where it's also available in English, Spanish, German, Italian and Portuguese. and in a number of languages, such as Japaneese and Spanish....
